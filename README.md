**Who was the client? What type of system did they want designed?**<br />
The client, DriverPass, was looking to create an applicaton that would facilitate driver education by allowing for students and instructors to coordinate driving lessons, as well as offer online lessons and pre-tests if students wanted them.

**What did you do particularly well?**<br />
In this project I feel like I did a particularly good job of functional and nonfunctional requirements in the Business Requirements Document, I made sure to thuroughly go through the interview trascript and I feel like I captured everything the client was looking for in the system.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**<br />
I would redo the UML Class diagram if I could, I was basing my class diagram off of previous UML diagrams I had made for previous coding classes and I don't think I correctly captured all the interactions and classes this system needed. I would remove the main class and instead have more interaction connections.

**How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?**<br />
I interpreted the user's needs by going through the interview transcript thoroughly to ensure that I understood what they were looking for in their system. I then wrote down functions that were requested and interpreted what was needed to make these functions work to come up with the nonfunctional requirements for the system. It is important to consider the user's needs as these will be the end users of the system and if the system that is created doesn't match what the needs of the end user then it's development will have been a waste of resources making something that wasn't requested.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**<br />
My approach to designing software starts with having a good requirements list, then taking these and mapping out how the system will need to function to effectively meet the requirements. Using a diagraming software helps to keep these maps organized and aesthetically pleasing so that they will be used. Going forward I will be using activity, sequencing and class diagrams as they are needed because they were all helpful in demonstrating different aspects of the system and assisting in the design process.
